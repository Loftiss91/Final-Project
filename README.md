# Project 03: Final Project - A Full Project Proposal 
## Loftiss Services - Home Improvement

<P> The purpose of this project is to create a website for my home improvement business, Loftiss Services.
The audience of the website will be those looking for handyman or home improvement services.
The website will be informative, it will provide a list of home improvement services that my business can provide. 
The website does not have booking capabilities, customers will need to either phone or email to schedule the service.
The cost of some services will be provided or estimated, others will refer to contacting my business for a free estimate.
