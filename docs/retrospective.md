# Project 03: Final Project - A Full Project Proposal
## Dillon Loftiss
    Reflecting on the entirity of Project 03, I have so many feelings. The strongest feelings at this very moment are happiness and accomplishment. 
As I'm writing this I am struggling to feel confidence though. Which kind of feels weird because I feel accomplished.
I guess that is a struggle because I fear making mistakes, especially silly mistakes. What went well? Overall I think everything went well, I didn't allow anything to overwhelm me. 
When I was stuck I checked my notes or reviewed the previous assignments.Looking over the previous assignments helped things "click" for me. 
I was able to look at something I had done in the weeks prior and it helped to "jog" my memory.
What went wrong? I honestly can't think of anything that went wrong. A minor issue I had was the the risk assessment. I didn't feel that I was going to have any issues with the risks.
So that made it a minor issue of trying to decide how to rate the risks. I might change my mind after it has been graded and mistakes are brought to my attention. 
Like I mentioned, if I got stuck, I didn't panic. I just reviewed what I learned and applied it. 
I also reviewed the instructions and expectations on the assignment page. I tried to pay really close attention to the details and apply what is expected. 
What would I do differently? I'm not sure, maybe choose a different topic for fun.
The topic I chose was fun but I guess I could have been more creative with the topic. A business website seems like it would be a popular choice. 
I guess if I had to do it all again I would choose something more creative or unique, or atleast try to be more creative. 
I just had a thought. After completing the peer review assignment, I had some things that I would change. One of my peers gave some great feedback.
After receiving this feedback I felt that the feedback I gave on the review was bland or generic. I would definetly give more feedback and give my peers areas to improve.
I would also be more informative in my own scope. My peer suggested providing more clear instruction. After looking back at my original scope, it lacked a lot.
I would do the scope differently as well as the feedback for others.
