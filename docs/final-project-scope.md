# Project Scope Statement - Dillon Loftiss

## Project Name: Business Website

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a website about my home improvement business. The website will inform customers of all the services that my business can provide in home improvement.
## Description
This project will be an informative website to the customer. The audience will be those looking for home improvement or handyman services.
I will provide the cost of some services, others will refer the customer to contacting the business via phone or email. 
## Desired Results
I want the website to give the customer enough information about what services are available. I want the customer to reach out via phone or email to schedule an estimate or book the service.
Customer interaction through phone or email is the goal. 
### I will need to create a new GitHub Repository containing the following: 
* __Documentation Folder__ - with the project scope statement, project plan, and project retrospective.
* __Two-page Website Prototype__ - With two HTML & CSS
* __README.md file__ - With a explanation of the website

The entire project for the website is due October 03, 2025, the website must be live and hosted by GitHub.

### I want to provide the following to the customers:
* Information about what services my business can provide.
* Estimated costs of some services, others will refer the customer to contact the business to schedule a free estimate.
* Contact information.
## Exclusions
I will not provide information on services my business cannot perform at this time. I will only include the services that I can currently perform. The website will not offer any booking services. The website is only informational and all bookings and estimates will have to be conducted through phone or email. There will be NO descriptions of each service, the services provided should be informative enough.
If the customer needs more information or has questions they will be referred to reach out via phone or email.

## Priorities
__1. TIME__ - I have about a week and a half to complete this project. 

__2. Quality__ - I would like to provide something to catch the customers' attention, maybe a nice color scheme. 
The website should provide the customers' with a clear understanding what services my business has to offer and be free of confusion. 

__3. Budget__ - The budget is completely free.

## Acceptance Criteria
Dr. Gamel will need to sign off on this project on the due date of October 03, 2025.
