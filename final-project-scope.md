# Project Scope Statement - Dillon Loftiss

## Project Name: Business Website

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a website about my home improvement business. The website will inform customers of all services that my business can provide in home improvement.
## Description
This project will provide a detailed website to the customer of the services that my business provides. The audience will be those looking for home improvement or handyman services. I will need to provide in detail what each service is and the cost. 
## Desired Results
I want the website to give the customer enough information about the services that are available. I want the customer to reach out via phone or email to schedule an estimate. 
### I will need to create a new GitHub Repository containing the following: 
* __Documentation Folder__ - with the project scope statement, project plan, and project retrospective.
* __Two-page Website Prototype__ - With HTML & CSS
* __README.md file__ - With a explanation of the website

The entire project for the website is due October 03, 2025, the website must be live and hosted by GitHub.

### I want to provide the following to the customers:
* Information about services my business can provide.
* Estimated costs of all the services.
* Contact information.
## Exclusions
I will not provide information on services my business cannot perform at this time. I will only include the services that I can currently perform. The website will not offer any booking services. The website is only informational and all bookings and estimates will have to be conducted through calls or email.

## Priorities
__1. TIME__ - I have about a week and a half to complete this project. 

__2. Quality__ - I would like to provide something to catch the customers' attention, maybe a nice color scheme. The website should provide the customers' with a clear understanding of the services and be free of confusion. 

__3. Budget__ - The budget is completely free.

## Acceptance Criteria
Dr. Gamel will need to sign off on this project on the due date of October 03, 2025.
